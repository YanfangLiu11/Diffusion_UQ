# Diffusion Uncertainty Quantification

This repository contains the implementation of a Conditional Generative Model developed to address specific challenges in uncertainty quantification using diffusion processes.

## Overview

This project aims to leverage deep learning methodologies, particularly generative models, to predict and quantify uncertainties in data-driven scenarios. The models are trained using a generative diffusion approach, suitable for complex datasets including bimodal distributions and experimental data from processes like ELM.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the core Python scripts for the model and data processing.
- `data/`: Directory for storing example datasets used by the models.
- `results/`: Stores output from model runs, including visualizations and model checkpoints.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating model usage and tutorials.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies required by the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
